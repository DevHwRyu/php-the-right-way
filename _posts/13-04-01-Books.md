## Books {#books_title}

There are a lot of books around for PHP but some are sadly now quite old and no
longer contain accurate information. There are even books published for "PHP 6"
which does not exist, any might not now ever exist because of those books. 

This section aims to be a living document for recommended books on PHP
development in general. Just like with the list of frameworks, there will no
doubt lots of interest in people adding their own books. Send a PR and see what
happens.
